# ETP rescue

This is an attempt at recovering the [Etruscan Texts Project](http://scholarworks.umass.edu/ces_texts/) database, that has been unavailable
for a few years now, but can still be recovered as it was in 2009 from the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20091126015235/http://etp.classics.umass.edu/cgi-bin/query.pl).

All data are copyright 2004-2005 Etruscan Texts Project, University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Please note that record ETP 406 is actually missing.
